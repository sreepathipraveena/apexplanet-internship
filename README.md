# apexplanet-internship
web developer intern 
my Week 1 project as an intern at Apex Planet!  

For this task, I created a simple webpage about **Nature** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
✅ Built headings, paragraphs, images, and links.  
✅ Styled the webpage with modern CSS design.  
✅ Added interactivity using JavaScript (click the button to see the alert!).
